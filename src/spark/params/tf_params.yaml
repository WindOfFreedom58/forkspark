# Frame names
global_frame: "world"
base_frame: "base_link"

# Static TF

# Translation: meters
# Rotation: radians

# In SVL's coordinate system:
# - pitch is rotation around x
# - yaw is rotation around y
# - roll is rotation around z

# In right handed coordinate system:
# - roll is rotation around x
# - pitch is rotation around y
# - yaw is rotation around z

# In TF, translations and rotations are converted to right handed coordinate frame according to https://www.svlsimulator.com/docs/getting-started/conventions/
